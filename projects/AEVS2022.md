I participated in the 2022-2023 AEVS(Autonomous Electrical Vehicle System) project as part of the electrical team.  This project would require me and my team to create an autonomous vehicle which could deliver parcels around the campus. During this project, I learned many things about working with a physical electronic system, as well as working effectively in a team environment.

During the beginning of the project, I worked on planning out all of the necessary components and wiring.  After creating an inventory list, I made a wiring diagram which included pin designations, voltage, amperage, and wire gauges. This put in consideration power calculations, proper voltage, and battery limits.

After creating the wiring diagram, I worked on installing the electronic components to the vehicle.  I was responsible for wiring all of the components into the AEV, such as the processing unit, cameras, linear actuators, motors, etc.  While the larger components were wired to the structure itself, we were able to create a electronics plate for the smaller components.  This would allow us to take the plate out for bench-testing the Jetson TX2, GPS, accelerometer, relay modules, and motor controllers.
